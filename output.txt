In many American families, children are expected to help around the house.
They are assigned "chores" which might include, for example, vacuuming the rugs,
washing and waxing floors, cleaning windows, mowing the lawn, shoveling snow,
keeping the car clean, looking after pets, and so on. Some families give a small amount of money,
an allowance, in exchange for these and similar chores.
Other families simply desire such work to be shared by everyone in the family.

At the same time, many American middle-class families want their children to find part-time jobs,
especially as they enter their teens. This might be working at the local supermarket or service station,
delivering newspapers or babysitting. Americans feel that young people should appreciate the value
of work and learn how to stand on their own two feet. In fact, about 75 percent of high school
seniors work during the average school week.

A lot of Americans expect their children to leave home at an earlier age than do parents
in many other western cultures. Beyond a certain age, they are often expected to contribute to, or pay
for things that go beyond food, clothing and shelter Many high school students have their own cars.
But most of them were paid for by the students themselves.
